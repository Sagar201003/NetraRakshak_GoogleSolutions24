Solution:
1. Suspicious activity detection:
   ● It will detect anomalies like Abuse , Assault , Arrestrunning, jumping, and crawling by analyzing the motion
   patterns of tracked humans. We will keep a track of all the objects using Deep sort.

2. Multiple video panels:
   ● It can process multiple videos in real time.

3. Identify risky items:
   ● Will be able to detect weapons , and sharp objects like Knife , Sword , etc.

4. Fire and Smoke detection:
   ● Our model detects both fire and smoke, triggering an immediate alarm for rapid
   response and enhanced safety measures.

5. Automatic number plate recognition system:
   ● We can add a number plate recognition system to our project , which may help
   officials to keep a track on the vehicles of the criminals.
6. Custom dataset:
   ● We can train our model on a custom dataset . given the dataset is relevant to the
   topic . This makes our model flexible for users .

7. Interdisciplinary Approach:
   ● The development involves proper integration of software and hardware , making it
   a challenging task suitable for an AI problem statement in a hackathon.

8. User Interface :
   ● Simple and User-friendly website . The dashboard will display the multiple real-time
   input videos.
9. History of incidents:
   ● We will create a database that will have all the past incidents .This will help the
   Police department to keep a track of all the incidents . It will include the date,time ,
   place where the incident occurred.

10. Alert System:
   ● Our smart system quickly raises an alarm if it notices anything unusual or
   suspicious. It also sends messages to officials about the activity .

11. Feedback :
   ● Proper feedback will be taken from the users, to make the system better.

Software and Technology:
1. Frontend:
   ● HTML, CSS, React.js
2. Backend:
   ● Django, Python
3. Database:
   ● PostgreSQL / Firebase
4. Model training:
   ● YOLOv8 , RESNET-50
5. Object tracking:
   ● Deep-sort algorithm

5. Pose estimation and activity recognition:
   ● OpenPose, Mediapipe

6. Video inferencing:
   ● OpenCV
7. Version control:
   ● GitHub
